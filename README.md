# STAT 319 - Elementary Mathematical Statistics

Here is everything I did for my STAT 319 course.

STAT 319 covers fundamental concepts in probability and statistics. Topics include probability distributions, expectation, variance, sampling distributions, estimation, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis. The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical application of statistical methods.
